‘Github Repo Explorer’

Contributors: Tony Chang, Dave Korff

If you’re looking for a simple way to search GitHub repos, you came to the right place.

This application is a tool you can use to create, find, update, and delete information about Github users and their repos.

- Create new GitHub users in our local SQLite3 database
- Research existing GitHub repos (up to 30 at a time - thanks, GitHub api)
- Update our local database
- Delete repos from our local database

To run the app, navigate to the main directory ‘guided-module-one-final-project-nyc-web-career-021819’ in Terminal and enter ‘ruby bin/run.rb’
